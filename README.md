Hybrid Model for Predicting Arrhythmia in Cancer Patients

üöÄ Project Overview

This project develops a hybrid machine learning model to predict arrhythmia in cancer patients using medical data such as ECG signals, patient history, and other relevant health indicators. The model combines traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning (LSTM-based) networks to improve prediction accuracy and support early diagnosis.

The full pipeline includes:

Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Training (Hybrid Model)
Model Evaluation
Deployment for Prediction
üéØ Objective

The aim is to build a predictive model that identifies the likelihood of arrhythmia in cancer patients, enabling earlier clinical interventions and potentially improving patient outcomes.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

To get started, clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/arrhythmia-cancer-prediction.git
cd arrhythmia-cancer-prediction
üìä Data

The dataset includes anonymized medical records such as:

ECG signal data
Medical history
Patient demographics
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Due to privacy concerns, raw patient data cannot be shared publicly. However, mock datasets and preprocessed examples are available within the repository for testing and demonstration purposes.

üß† Model Architecture

The hybrid model consists of the following components:

1. Preprocessing Layer
Normalization of ECG and other numerical features
Feature engineering for clinical relevance
2. Machine Learning Layer
Traditional models (e.g., Random Forest, SVM) for structured data
3. Deep Learning Layer
LSTM: To capture temporal patterns in ECG signals
Dense Neural Network: Final classification output
4. Hybrid Fusion
Combines both machine learning and deep learning predictions for higher accuracy
