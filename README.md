# Hybrid Model for Predicting Arrhythmia in Cancer Patients

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a hybrid machine learning model for predicting arrhythmia in cancer patients based on medical data such as ECG signals, patient history, and other relevant medical features. The model combines traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning (neural networks) to improve prediction accuracy and assist healthcare professionals in making early interventions.

The project includes a full pipeline that involves:

Data Preprocessing
Feature Engineering
Model Training (Hybrid Model)
Model Evaluation
Deployment for Prediction
