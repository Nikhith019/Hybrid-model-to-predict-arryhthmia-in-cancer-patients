# Hybrid Model for Predicting Arrhythmia in Cancer Patients

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a hybrid machine learning model for predicting arrhythmia in cancer patients based on medical data such as ECG signals, patient history, and other relevant medical features. The model combines traditional machine learning techniques with deep learning (neural networks) to improve prediction accuracy and assist healthcare professionals in making early interventions.

The project includes a full pipeline that involves:

1)Data Preprocessing

2)Feature Engineering

3)Model Training (Hybrid Model)

4)Model Evaluation

5)Deployment for Prediction

## Objective

The goal is to develop a model capable of predicting the likelihood of arrhythmia occurring in cancer patients, which could help in early diagnosis and improve treatment outcomes.

## Project Setup

### Clone the Repository

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/arrhythmia-cancer-prediction.git

cd arrhythmia-cancer-prediction

## Data

The data used in this project contains features such as ECG signal data, medical history, and patient demographics. The dataset is anonymized and consists of multiple attributes related to cancer patients. Due to privacy concerns, raw patient data cannot be shared directly, but mock data or preprocessed datasets are available in the repository.

## Model Architecture

### The hybrid model consists of the following components:

1.Preprocessing Layer:

*Normalization of ECG data and relevant features.

*Feature Engineering for arrhythmia prediction.

2.Machine Learning Layer:

*Traditional machine learning models are used in conjunction with deep learning layers.

3.Deep Learning Layer:

*LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): To capture sequential patterns in ECG signals over time.
*Dense Neural Network: For final classification of arrhythmia.

4.Hybrid Model: 

*The hybrid model combines machine learning techniques with neural networks to improve prediction accuracy.
